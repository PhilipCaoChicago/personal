    "## An (attempt at an) Introduction to Computational Social Science with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- by Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial was first conducted at PyCon India 2020 ([CFP](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2020/proposals/python-for-computational-social-science-with-text-networks-and-clever-data-games~dyPPE/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Social Science is a broad, diverse field, and no tutorial, let alone Jupyter notebook, can claim to give a true introduction to the field: what we will attempt to do in this notebook is understand the _kinds_ of approaches one might be able to take when dealing with a variety of computational social science questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is Computational Social Science? It includes the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches (such as data scraping, data cleaning, machine learning, natural language processing and others) to various social science disciplines. Social science disciplines include Economics, Sociology, Psychology, Political Science, Anthropology, Cultural Studies (and sometimes History & Science-Technology-Society Studies). Examples of computational approaches to social science questions could be characterising tie forming in friendship groups, analysing tweets to identify sentiment towards political groups, modelling economies and their reactions to changes in policy, or identifying how words in a language change meaning over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the idea of computational social science is based in academia and research, we see usages of these ideas by big tech companies all the time: for example, when we see a friend or page suggestion on a social media website, or a movie recommendation on Netflix. In research, academic and experimental rigor is valued more than a business oriented approach, but the core ideas often remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational paradigm has taken off due to a congruence of hardware (GPUs, TPUs), software (larger communities of open source software, increasingly sophisticated sophisticated software and environments), and large amounts of available social data. Social data can range from curated datasets we can find on kaggle or the UCI repository, or data we mine from reddit or twitter. Important aspects of Computational Social Science include choosing a right research question, studying the theoretical underpinnings associated with the questions, and setting up an experiment or mining data which might be able to appropriately address the question. Given that this is a tough expercise, and requires extensive academic coursework, I will be skipping the academic rigor, to instead explore the kinds of approaches and methods one might encounter in Computational Social Science research.\n",
    "\n",
    "How will this tutorial be useful to you? It will include basic examples of code with small datasets to illustrate a variety of methods often used in CSS research. This includes (and is not limited to) text analysis via Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, network and graph oriented methods, and building classifiers and regression models trained on a variety of social data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is difficult to represent all of these methods, I will only focus on a few, with a focus on NLP and CL, as these are the methods I have most experience in. We will then move on to network based methods, and finally move on to a combination of both text and networks. The tutorial will assume basic python knowledge but not much else: do not worry if some of the methods or ideas don't make sense yet. A lot of the words and ideas I have used in this tutorial have ample resources available if you wish to understand them, and you are also welcome to e-mail / tweet at me any questions you have and I will do my best to answer them. If you find yourself reproducing parts of this tutorial for your own work or tutorials, please do cite / shout-out / reference this original tutorial and page, thank you!"

    "### Where do you find data? What is the correct dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an always challenging question. Really, it depends on the question you want to answer: there are a lot of considerations one must take when deciding if a dataset is the right one to answer your social science question. Since this tutorial would like to introduce a wide variety of methods, the dataset we choose has to be one which is ammenable to a variety of approaches: to that end, I have decided to use the script for the Indo-British film, _Bend it like Beckham_. Why this film? It's simply the last movie I watched, I enjoyed it watching it as a kid back in the early 2000s, and the movie also kicks _ass_. For those who may not have seen it, it was the story of how an Indian-British Punjabi girl, Jesminder (Jess) and her coming of age story of becoming a professional footballer. I have to apologize - SPOILERS! During the various methods we will be applying throughout the notebook, you might learn things about the movie you might have wanted to keep a surprise if you haven't seen it. \n",
    "\n",
    "I found the script of the movie through a simple google search, at https://www.swcs.com.au/bend.htm. Like you so far, I have no clue what to expect of the results of the analysis - we are going to try and use the data in its avaible form to create objects of analysis for us. Let is start by setting up some basic imports and reading the data, and thinking of useful representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports and Data\n",

    "Arguably the most important part of Computational Social Science is cleaning and organising the data. The following cells will have you follow me as I work to set up the best representations to analyse the dataset."

       "[\"John: David Beckham gets the ball yet again for Manchester United. He's really taking responsibility every time they have possession. This is really a reflection of the way he's been playing and captaining England. He seems to have matured so much as a player He's dominating proceedings here but, hoping perhaps to get a bit more support as he gathers the ball on this right-hand touchline time after time. And the Old Trafford crowd warming now to the way Beckham is taking over, but the big questionmark here against Manchester United is, where is the goal going to come from to break down Anderlecht? Will it be Scholes? Could it possibly be Ryan Giggs? Would it possibly be Beckham himself who breaks through? Because Anderlecht are playing a very controlled game. This is Radzinski, testing the United defence, and Sylvestre here at left back possibly with a chance to break forward on the other flank. And there's the ball that Beckham really wants. Oh that looked like a body check there, but he shrugged off the defender. Still Beckham, plenty in the middle, It's a decent cross, and there is Bhamra. It's a fine header, and she's scored! Oh it's a goal by Jess Bhamra! A superb header here, beating the defender, and planting the ball beyond the goalkeeper's left hand. Jess Bhamra makes a name for herself at Old Trafford!

This is really a reflection of the way he's been playing and captaining England. He seems to have matured so much as a player He's dominating proceedings here but, hoping perhaps to get a bit more support as he gathers the ball on this right-hand touchline time after time. And the Old Trafford crowd warming now to the way Beckham is taking over, but the big questionmark here against Manchester United is, where is the goal going to come from to break down Anderlecht? Will it be Scholes? Could it possibly be Ryan Giggs? Would it possibly be Beckham himself who breaks through? Because Anderlecht are playing a very controlled game. This is Radzinski, testing the United defence, and Sylvestre here at left back possibly with a chance to break forward on the other flank. And there's the ball that Beckham really wants. Oh that looked like a body check there, but he shrugged off the defender. Still Beckham, plenty in the middle, It's a decent cross, and there is Bhamra. It's a fine header, and she's scored! Oh it's a goal by Jess Bhamra! A superb header here, beating the defender, and planting the ball beyond the goalkeeper's left hand. Jess Bhamra makes a name for herself at Old Trafford! And have we discovered a new star here, Gary Lineker?\\n\""

    "## Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is used as information in all kinds of situations, and is used heavily in social scientific analysis. There are a very wide variety of text related methods one can use for different purposes. Text analysis can be useful for clasdsifying documents and lines, for identifying intent, semantic content, parts of speech, named entities, and many more purposes. It can even be used to generate text, such as in chatbots. For a tutorial focusing only on text analysis, please see: https://github.com/bhargavvader/personal/blob/master/notebooks/text_analysis_tutorial/text_analysis_tutorial.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using one of the methods used in that notebook: Topic Modelling. Topic modelling is an unsupervised statistical learning algorithm which can be used to identify topics in large bodies of text. For example, if we were running topic models on newspapers, we'd likely see topics associated to the weather, politics, and sports. The algorithm assumes that topics are made of words, and documents are made of words. Similarly, documents can also be thought of as made up of topics. All of this will be more clear once we see the actual topics generated.\n",

    "\n",
    "NOTE: the results of the topic models are different every time, so some of the text descriptions might not match up, it is because it is about the results I first got."

    "## Conclusions and Ways Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "Phew - there was a lot going on there! We explored a variety of concepts, from networks, to topic models, to measuring similarities between topic models. These methods serve as the base for a variety of more complex analysis, and hopefully have served as a way to illustrate the kinds of tools Computational Social Scientists use throughout the analysis. A huge part of the notebook was also cleaning and organising data into different structures so that we can analyse them: this is a very important part of Computational Social Science, and indeed any data analysis exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the movie we chose to analyse may not have thrown us any very surprusing results, it did help in providing us some useful summarising ideas about the movie which we understood only by looking at the text of the script. While Social Scientists may not sit around analysing movie texts, if the process is operationalised to a large number of movies, it may be useful to have some of the metrics we learned in the tutorial today. Different social scientists use different parts of the tools we explored today to carry out their analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to carry out your own academic research and analysis, focus on your research question and what kind of data might be helpful in answering the question. Then, explore the exisiting literature on the question, and think of a computational technique might help in add to the literature in a useful way. Outside of academia, these methods can still be used for a variety of business and personal needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy researching and problem solving - and feel free to reach out to me for any clarifications, advice, or suggestions/errata!"
